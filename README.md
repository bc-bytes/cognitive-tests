# cognitive-tests
Java source code for three types of cognitive tests - trail making,
reaction time, and paired associates learning. The target framework is libGDX.

You will need to create a new libGDX project to import these Java
classes into. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Creating%20Projects.html) (click on
the "Download LibGDX project setup tool link").

If you use any part of this code in a research project, please consider citing [our paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295106328_Mobile_Framework_for_Cognitive_Assessment_Trail_Making_Test_and_Reaction_Time_Test).

Also, please read the DISCLAIMER before using any of this code.
