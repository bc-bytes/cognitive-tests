# cognitive-tests
Java source code for three types of cognitive tests - trail making,
reaction time, and paired associates learning. The target framework is libGDX.

You will need to create a new libGDX project to import these Java
classes into. Instructions on how to do that can be found here (click on
the "Download LibGDX project setup tool link"):
