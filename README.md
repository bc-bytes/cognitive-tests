# Cognitive Tests: Trail Making, Reaction Time, and Paired Associates Learning
Java source code for three types of cognitive tests - trail making,
reaction time, and paired associates learning. The target framework is libGDX.

You will need to create a new libGDX project to import these Java
classes into. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/project-generation).

Note that this code was written in 2014, so you may find it easier to use a libGDX version from that year as functionality of the framework may have changed since. Please also note that we do not offer any technical support.

If you use any part of this code in a research project, please consider citing [our paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295106328_Mobile_Framework_for_Cognitive_Assessment_Trail_Making_Test_and_Reaction_Time_Test):
